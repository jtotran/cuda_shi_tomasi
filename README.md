Description
-----------

The following is a parallelized implementation of Shi Tomasi. Shi Tomasi is an algorithm that is able to extract corners from an image. Due to the having to work with large matrices, this would benefit highly from CUDA. The project also includes a performance analysis and scripts to obtain run times from the programs.
